# MORTGAGE CALCULATOR TEST ANALYSIS & FIXES

## CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND:

### 1. SLIDER AUTOMATION FAILURE
- **Problem**: Tests cannot set loan term slider (100% failure rate)
- **Root Cause**: shadcn/ui Slider doesn't expose standard input[type="range"]
- **Impact**: All tests default to 30 years

### 2. CALCULATION ACCURACY ISSUES
- **Up to 99% error rate** between expected and actual payments
- **Examples**:
  - Expected: $717.30 → Actual: $4.00 (99.4% error)
  - Expected: $825.46 → Actual: $284.00 (65.6% error)

### 3. TEST RELIABILITY PROBLEMS
- Edge case tests timing out
- Form field interaction failures

## FIXES IMPLEMENTED:

### A. Enhanced Slider with Test Attributes
- Added data-testid="loan-term-slider" 
- Added hidden input for test automation
- Improved accessibility

### B. Fixed Calculation Logic
- Corrected principal/interest breakdown
- Fixed edge case handling
- Improved tax/insurance estimates

### C. Improved Test Automation
- Better slider interaction methods
- More reliable element selection
- Enhanced error handling

## RECOMMENDATIONS:

### 1. IMMEDIATE FIXES (Critical - Deploy ASAP)
- ✅ Fix slider automation
- ✅ Correct calculation formulas
- ✅ Add proper test attributes

### 2. ACCURACY IMPROVEMENTS (High Priority)
- ✅ Implement proper amortization calculation
- ✅ Fix principal/interest breakdown
- ✅ Validate against known mortgage formulas

### 3. TESTING ENHANCEMENTS (Medium Priority)
- ✅ Add comprehensive test scenarios
- ✅ Improve error handling
- ✅ Add performance monitoring

### 4. USER EXPERIENCE (Low Priority)
- Consider adding mortgage type selection
- Add PMI calculations for <20% down
- Include local tax rate selection

## TEST RESULTS SUMMARY:

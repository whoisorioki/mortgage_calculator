## üöÄ Azure Deployment Testing Guide

### Pre-Deployment Steps:

1. **Build the application**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy to Azure Static Web Apps**:
   - **Option A**: Azure CLI
     ```bash
     az staticwebapp create --name mortgage-calculator --resource-group my-resource-group --source .
     ```
   - **Option B**: GitHub Actions (automatic deployment)
   - **Option C**: VS Code Azure Static Web Apps extension

### Post-Deployment Testing:

1. **Update test configuration**:
   ```typescript
   // playwright.config.ts
   baseURL: 'https://your-app-name.azurestaticapps.net'
   ```

2. **Run automated tests against production**:
   ```bash
   npm run test:e2e
   ```

3. **Manual testing checklist**:
   - [ ] Test all 8 scenarios from the spreadsheet
   - [ ] Verify responsive design on different devices
   - [ ] Check HTTPS security
   - [ ] Test form validation
   - [ ] Verify calculation accuracy
   - [ ] Test browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
   - [ ] Performance testing (load time, calculation speed)

## üìÅ Clean Project Structure

After cleanup and standardization, the project now follows these naming conventions:

### File Naming Standards:
- **React Components**: PascalCase (e.g., `Home.tsx`, `InputForm.tsx`)
- **Scripts**: kebab-case (e.g., `run-tests.sh`, `test-scenarios.sh`)
- **Configuration**: lowercase (e.g., `package.json`, `vite.config.ts`)
- **Documentation**: UPPERCASE (e.g., `README.md`, `COMPREHENSIVE_TEST_REPORT.md`)
